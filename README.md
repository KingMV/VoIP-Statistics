A script that allows you to simulate different types of traffic given
histograms for shaping the traffic, as well as generate abnormal traffic.

The script then calculates hellinger distance, mahalanobis distance, average,
and standard deviations for the distances, as well as the data sets.

It will analyze the data distances and data sets looking for calculated
thresholds to be exceeded.

It uses pyplot to generate plots that illustrate this statistical information.
